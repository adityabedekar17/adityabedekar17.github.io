## **Work Experience**

### **Graduate Student Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*Oct 2025 – Dec 2025*  
Focused on **circuit reliability and hardware security**. Currently working on TDDB (Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown).

### **Graduate Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*Jul 2024 – Jun 2025*  
- Developed a **TCAD-based workflow** (Synopsys Sentaurus) to model BTI-induced threshold voltage shifts in 7nm FinFET architectures, including stress and recovery.  
- Integrated **SPICE-based tools** (PySpice, Xyce, HSPICE MOSRA) to characterize circuit-level aging, enabling **clock-to-Q delay analysis** in Sky130 standard cells.  
- Simulated **PMOS/NMOS degradation** under varying stress voltages and temperatures, quantifying BTI impact on timing reliability.  
- Investigated **hardware security implications** of BTI, identifying side-channel vulnerabilities in FPGA fabrics due to NBTI-induced degradation.  

### **Teaching Assistant, UC Santa Cruz**  
*Jan 2024 – Jun 2025*  
- Led lab sections for 100+ students in **Advanced Computer Networks** and **Introduction to Networking**.  
- Covered **TCP/IP, VLAN, OSI model, LAN security, Layer 2 & Layer 3 switches, OSPF, BGP, HSRP, VRRP, BPDU, PortFast**.  
- Assisted with coursework, grading, and developed a **QR-based attendance system** to improve class efficiency.  

### **Intern, Godrej & Boyce**  
*Summer 2022*  
- Implemented **data acquisition from industrial sensors** using Modbus and UART.  
- Achieved **real-time visualization** on HMI devices via RS-232.

## **Projects**

### **Local RAG Assistant for SPICE & TCAD Workflows**  
- Built a **local RAG workflow** with LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace embeddings to query 8,000+ pages of SPICE/TCAD documentation.  
- Integrated **offline LLM inference** (Mistral, Llama3) with vector search to provide fact-grounded answers for reliability simulations (BTI, HCI, TDDB).  
- Improved **engineering productivity** by reducing query time from hours to seconds, with responses citing **page numbers and references**.  

### **Cache Performance Optimization Using ESESC Simulator**  
- Simulated and optimized the **LZW compression algorithm** on a single-core RISC-V processor.  
- Reduced **L2 cache miss rate** from 99.8% to 58% and improved **IPC from 0.26 to 0.44** (1.69×).  
- Analyzed cache bottlenecks and identified optimization strategies for L1/L2 configurations.  

### **Logic Design, Synthesis, and Verification on FPGA**  
- Designed logic systems on the **Lattice iCE40 FPGA**, incorporating AXI, memory, LUTs, and DSP operations.  
- Built optimized **FIFO and MAC units** and performed **functional and formal verification** with open-source toolchains.  
- Executed **PnR and CDC verification** across multiple clock domains.
