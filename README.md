## **Experience**

### **Graduate Student Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*Oct 2025 – Dec 2025*  
 - Led advanced BTI reliability modeling at sub-7nm nodes by building scalable SPICE workflows for **7nm FinFET** and **3nm GAAFET** standard cells across temperature and stress corners. 
- Appended BSIM-CMG model card with PDK-consistent, physics-accurate parameters to enable predictive aging analysis 
 -Designed a containerized Docker pipeline for automated delay extraction and visualization, enabling rapid comparison of aging-induced propagation delay shifts. 
 - Designed and simulated a 7nm FinFET inverter in TCAD, extracting device-level aging characteristics.
### **Graduate Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*Jul 2024 – Jun 2025*  
- Developed a **TCAD-based workflow** (Synopsys Sentaurus) to model BTI-induced threshold voltage shifts in 7nm FinFET architectures, including stress and recovery.  
- Integrated **SPICE-based tools** (PySpice, Xyce, HSPICE MOSRA) to characterize circuit-level aging, enabling **clock-to-Q delay analysis** in Sky130 standard cells.  
- Simulated **PMOS/NMOS degradation** under varying stress voltages and temperatures, quantifying BTI impact on timing reliability.  
- Investigated **hardware security implications** of BTI, identifying side-channel vulnerabilities in FPGA fabrics due to NBTI-induced degradation.
