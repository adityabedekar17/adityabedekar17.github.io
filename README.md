## **Work Experience**
### **Graduate Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*July 2024 â€“ Present*  
I am currently investigating **Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) in advanced nodes**, focusing on **Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)** a key reliability issue in **planar, FinFET architectures**. NBTI leads to threshold voltage shifts in PMOS devices, inducing **circuit aging and timing degradation** that threaten long-term reliability and open pathways for **hardware security vulnerabilities**.

Since Summer 2024, I have conducted a **comprehensive literature survey** and performed **modeling and simulation** of BTI using both **SPICE-level degradation models** and **TCAD-based physical simulation workflows**. These simulations analyze the **stress and recovery phases**, enabling the study of aging-induced shifts in standard cell timing (e.g., clk-to-Q delay) under various thermal and electrical stress conditions.

My research includes:
- **Circuit-level SPICE simulations** of NBTI aging using **Sky130nm and ASAP7nm open-source PDKs**, evaluated through **Synopsys HSPICE and MOSRA** models.
- **Device-level modeling of BTI** in **7nm FinFETs** using **Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD**, accurately capturing **temperature-dependent stress and recovery behavior**.
- Exploration of **NBTI-induced delay degradation in sequential elements** such as D flip-flops and its implications on **metastability margins** and system timing reliability.
- Analysis of **NBTI-based hardware security threats**, through BTI-induced degradation.
