## **Work Experience**
### **Graduate Researcher, Hardware Systems Collective, UC Santa Cruz**  
*July 2024 - Present*  
I am currently focused on **characterizing and modeling Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Timing Violations**, with a particular emphasis on **Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)**â€”a critical reliability challenge in **planar, FinFET, and Gate-All-Around FET (GAAFET) architectures**.  

Since Summer 2024, I have conducted an extensive **literature review** on **NBTI characterization methodologies**, exploring various approaches to modeling its impact on circuit reliability. My work involves using **open-source and industry-standard tools** for **MOSFET reliability analysis**, including:  
- **Open-Source PDKs:** Sky130nm and ASAP7nm  
- **Circuit Simulation Tools:** PySpice, Xyce, Synopsys HSPICE MOSRA, and Cadence AgeMOS  

Additionally, I have explored **metastability measurement techniques and wear-out models**, which intersect with my broader interests in **TCAD modeling and semiconductor reliability analysis**.
